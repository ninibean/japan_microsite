# Aka: A Scroll-based Web Experience
An interactive web experience exploring my travels through Japan, told through the lens of my favorite color: red.

## What I'm Building
- Scroll-based storytelling experience
- Polaroid-style image reveals, image changes from black and white to color on mouse hover
- Cream background, film aesthetic, serene pacing

## Tech
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Next Steps
1. Select 7-10 photos
2. Build basic structure
3. Style Polaroid frames
4. Add scroll animations
5. Polish and deploy

## Notes and updates

## Goal
I'm aiming to replicate the feelings of serenity and nostalgia that are still stuck with me a whole year later into this web-based experience.
